This data science project series walks through step by step process of how to build a real estate. We will first build a model using sklearn and linear regression using vizag home prices dataset. During model building we will cover almost all data science concepts such as data load and cleaning, outlier detection and removal, feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, gridsearchcv for hyperparameter tunning, k fold cross validation etc. Technology and tools wise this project covers. This gives a clear understanding in finding out the outliers that are mostly used to predict the area and the location based on city.
Python
Numpy and Pandas for data cleaning
Matplotlib for data visualization
Sklearn for model building
